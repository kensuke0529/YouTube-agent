# Railway Deployment Fix

## 🚨 Issue: Pre-deploy Command Failed

Your Railway deployment is failing during the pre-deploy command. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔧 Solutions Applied

### 1. **Removed Pre-deploy Command**
- The pre-deploy command `pip install -r requirements.txt` was causing issues
- Railway's Nixpacks builder handles dependency installation automatically
- Removed the redundant pre-deploy step

### 2. **Added nixpacks.toml Configuration**
- Created explicit build configuration for Railway
- Specifies Python 3.9 and pip installation
- Defines proper build phases

### 3. **Simplified railway.json**
- Removed buildCommand override
- Let Nixpacks handle the build process automatically
- Kept essential deployment settings

## 📋 Files Updated

### `railway.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### `nixpacks.toml` (New)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python39", "pip"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["pip install -r requirements.txt"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["echo 'Build phase completed'"]

[start]
cmd = "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes to your GitHub repository
2. **Railway will automatically redeploy** with the new configuration
3. **Monitor the deployment** in Railway dashboard

## 🔍 If Still Failing

### Check Railway Logs
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Check "Build Logs" and "Deploy Logs" for specific errors

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **Python Version Issues**
```toml
# In nixpacks.toml, try different Python versions:
nixPkgs = ["python310", "pip"]  # or python311
```

#### 2. **Dependency Conflicts**
```bash
# Test locally first:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip check
```

#### 3. **Memory Issues**
- Railway free tier has limited memory
- Consider upgrading to paid plan if needed

#### 4. **Port Issues**
- Ensure your app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- Railway sets the PORT environment variable

## 🎯 Expected Result

After these changes, your deployment should:
1. ✅ Build successfully without pre-deploy errors
2. ✅ Install all Python dependencies correctly
3. ✅ Start the FastAPI application
4. ✅ Pass health checks at `/health`

## 📞 Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Railway's [Python deployment guide](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/python)
2. Review Railway's [troubleshooting docs](https://docs.railway.app/troubleshooting)
3. Check Railway's Discord community for help

The deployment should now work correctly! 🚀
