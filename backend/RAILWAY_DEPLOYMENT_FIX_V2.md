# Railway Deployment Fix V2

## 🚨 Issue: Nixpacks Build Failure

The deployment is failing because of Nixpacks configuration issues. Here's the updated fix:

## 🔧 Solutions Applied

### 1. **Removed nixpacks.toml**
- The custom Nixpacks configuration was causing build failures
- Railway's auto-detection works better for Python projects
- Let Railway handle the build process automatically

### 2. **Added runtime.txt**
- Specifies Python 3.10.12 for consistent builds
- Helps Railway choose the right Python version
- Prevents version conflicts

### 3. **Simplified Configuration**
- Removed all custom build commands
- Let Railway's Nixpacks auto-detect Python project
- Kept only essential deployment settings

## 📋 Current Configuration

### `railway.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### `runtime.txt` (New)
```
python-3.10.12
```

### `requirements.txt` (Unchanged)
```
fastapi==0.112.2
uvicorn[standard]==0.30.6
pydantic==2.9.2
httpx==0.27.2
python-dotenv==1.0.1
beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
yt-dlp==2025.1.12
openai==1.51.2
faiss-cpu>=1.8.0
numpy==1.26.4
```

### `Procfile` (Backup)
```
web: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## 🚀 How Railway Will Build

1. **Auto-detect Python project** from requirements.txt
2. **Install Python 3.10.12** from runtime.txt
3. **Install dependencies** from requirements.txt
4. **Start application** with the startCommand

## 🔍 Expected Build Process

```
✅ Detecting Python project
✅ Installing Python 3.10.12
✅ Installing pip dependencies
✅ Starting uvicorn server
✅ Health check at /health
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes
2. **Railway will automatically redeploy**
3. **Monitor the build logs** for success

## 🚨 If Still Failing

### Alternative Approach: Use Procfile
If Railway still has issues, you can:
1. Remove `railway.json` entirely
2. Railway will use the `Procfile` instead
3. This is a more traditional deployment approach

### Check Railway Settings
1. Go to Railway project settings
2. Ensure the **Root Directory** is set to `backend`
3. Verify **Build Command** is empty (auto-detect)
4. Check **Start Command** matches your Procfile

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Python version conflicts** - runtime.txt should fix this
2. **Dependency installation failures** - requirements.txt is valid
3. **Port binding issues** - startCommand uses $PORT correctly
4. **Health check failures** - /health endpoint exists

### Debug Steps:
1. Check Railway build logs for specific errors
2. Test locally: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
3. Verify all imports work: `python -c "import app.main"`

## 🎉 Expected Result

After these changes:
- ✅ Build should complete successfully
- ✅ Dependencies should install without errors
- ✅ Application should start and pass health checks
- ✅ API should be accessible at your Railway URL

The deployment should now work! 🚀
